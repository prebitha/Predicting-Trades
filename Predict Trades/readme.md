# BONUS TASK - PREDICT NUMBER OF TRADES AFTER 6TH MONTH

### OBJECTIVE : we want to predict the Number of Trades a customer will make after 6 months of trading 

## APPROACH : 


- [X] STEP 1 : Data Wrangling
- [X] STEP 2 : Data Transformation to make it stationary and supervised
- [X] STEP 3 : Building the LSTM model & evaluation
- [X] STEP 4 : Machine Learning
- [X] STEP 5 : Visualise the Prediction

## STEP 1+ 2 : DATA WRANGLING & DATA TRANSFORMATION

As We want to predict the number of Trades a customer will make after 6 months or after 3 Trades

FIRSTLY -  I grouped the date and the sum of number of Trades by groupby function

SECONDLY - Then I added a two new column

1. Data of previous months number of trades
2. Data of the difference between previous number of trades and current number of trades

LASTLY - we add the lag = 1 differencing. Specifically, to rescale the data to values between -1 and 1 to meet the default hyperbolic tangent activation function of the LSTM model.

## STEP 3 : BUILDING THE LSTM MODEL & EVALUATION

FIRSTLY - OLS regression using Formulae in the Statsmodels.formula.api

THEN -  we will fit the model and check the adjusted r squared to validate the model and we have adjusted r squared is 1 for our Regression model. Standard Errors assume that the covariance matrix of the errors is correctly specified.

FINALLY - so now we will train the model and test it to predict the number of trades the customer makes after 6 months.

## STEP 4 : MACHINE LEARNING

**STEP 1** : Scale the data using MinMax scaler

**STEP 2** : Define the Test and Train data

**STEP 3** : Fit the Model - I used the LSTM model as mentioned earlier

**STEP 4** : Make a DataFrame from the predicted value and merge this to the actual data mt: monthly trade

**STEP 5** : Plot the Number of Trades with the Predicted Number of Trades

**STEP 6** : Predict the Number of Trades for individual customer. I choose customer 6276

**STEP 7** : Visualise
