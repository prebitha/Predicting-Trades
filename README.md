# DATA SCIENCE CHALLENGE

### TASK 1: ADVANCED SQL

This part of the challenge was performed in MySql Workbench. 

### TASK 2 : ANALYSE TRADING ACTIVITY DATA

This part of the challenge I choose to work on visualizations in Tableau.

### TASK 3 : CLUSTER CUSTOMERS

This part of the challenge was done in Python. To cluster the Customers I used Kmeans ML Model to train the Data and we get 6 clusters i.e K=5.
I do some Further analysis on the Cluster of Customers to figure who is the ideal Cluster of Customer*

* Ideal Customer is the one who makes more number of trades, as Trade Republic makes money from transactions.
